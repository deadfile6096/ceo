# CEO of Nothing

A satirical startup simulator where you can generate ridiculous business ideas, enhance them with buzzwords, add pixel logos, and pitch to imaginary investors.

## About

"CEO of Nothing" is a single-page browser game with a pixel art style and garage/bedroom founder vibes. It's intentionally simple and janky, like something built during a 24-hour hackathon.

## Features

- Generate random startup ideas
- Enhance ideas with tech buzzwords
- Add terrible pixel logos
- Pitch to imaginary investors
- Share ideas to a community feed
- View and interact with other "founders" ideas

## Setup

This is a vanilla JavaScript project with no dependencies. Simply open `index.html` in a web browser to run the application.

## Asset Placeholders

The project currently includes placeholder files for:

- Sound effects (in the `sounds` folder)
- Background image (in the `images` folder)

You'll need to replace these with actual assets before deploying:

### Sound Files
- `sounds/click.mp3` - Button click sound
- `sounds/success.mp3` - Success sound effect
- `sounds/fail.mp3` - Failure sound effect

### Images
- `images/garage-bg.png` - Pixel art garage/bedroom background

## Customization

You can easily customize the game by editing the arrays in `script.js`:

- `startupIdeas` - List of random startup ideas
- `buzzwords` - Tech buzzwords to enhance ideas
- `logos` - Currently emoji placeholders, replace with paths to pixel art logos
- `pitchResults` - Humorous investor responses

## Browser Compatibility

This game is designed for desktop browsers only and works best in modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari.

## License

This project is intended for personal use and learning purposes.
